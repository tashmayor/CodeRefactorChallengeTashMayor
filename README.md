# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: Accessibility.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency.

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards.

SO THAT our own site is optimised for search engines.

## What have I learnt
The semantic HTML tags help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of web pages.

Pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read. 

It has greater accessibility. It offers a better user experience.
